# Odin Recipes

## Introduction

This repository is a submission for the Odin Project curriculum - a basic website project aimed at practicing HTML skills and mastering the git and GitHub workflow. The project revolves around creating a simple website called "Odin's Recipes," where we explore the world of culinary delights through HTML.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of this project is to reinforce HTML fundamentals and get hands-on experience with version control using git and GitHub. By building this basic website, we aim to:

- Solidify our understanding of HTML structure and elements.
- Apply knowledge of HTML tags, attributes, and semantic markup.
- Practice the process of adding, committing, and pushing code changes using git and GitHub.

## Project Description

In this project, we will create a basic static website named "Odin Recipes" that showcases a collection of recipes. The website will have the following features:

- A homepage that welcomes users to Odin Recipes.
- A list of recipe categories to explore.
- A sample recipe page with detailed instructions.
- A simple navigation system for easy browsing (basically a link back to the home page).

## Learning Goals

Through this project, we aim to achieve the following learning goals:

1. **HTML Proficiency:** Master the essential HTML tags and create well-structured web pages.

2. **Version Control:** Practice using git commands for version control, creating commits, and pushing changes to GitHub.
