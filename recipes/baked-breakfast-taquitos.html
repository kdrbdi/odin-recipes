    <br>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Heat 1 teaspoon oil in a large nonstick skillet heat over medium heat. Add mushrooms, bell pepper, and onion; cook until tender, stirring occasionally, about 4 minutes. Add kale. Cook and stir until wilted, about 1 minute. Remove from skillet.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Add eggs and egg whites to the hot skillet. Cook over medium heat, without stirring, until mixture begins to set on the bottom and around the edges. With a spatula, lift and fold the partially cooked egg mixture so the uncooked portion flows underneath. Continue cooking until egg mixture is cooked through but still glossy and moist, 2 to 3 minutes. Return vegetable mixture to skillet with cheese and chiles; stir gently to combine.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Fill each tortilla with about 1/3 cup filling; roll up as tightly as possible. Arrange taquitos, seam side down, on the prepared baking sheet, leaving space between each. Brush evenly with remaining 3 teaspoons oil.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Bake in the preheated oven until evenly browned and crispy, about 15 minutes or. Serve with salsa and, if desired, toppers.</p>
        </li>
    </ol>
